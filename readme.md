# blogsidian

OAAS obsidian as a service.

Wanted a simple way to upload blog posts straight from obsidian markdown, I have seen there are a bunch of similar implementations, but nothing quite what I wanted. Plus its always fun to build stuff from scratch.


Basic Idea is: 

CLI HELPER -> blogsidian -> HTML

Just simply push your post to blogsidian and it will put it into a sqlite database for you as parsed html.
